# Faasos_SQL_Analysis_Project

This project focuses on managing and analyzing Faasos Online Food Ordering, with a special emphasis on rolls and customer experience. It aims to optimize online food orders and provide insights for an improved delivery experience.
The company gained popularity by introducing the concept of "wraps on wheels" and gradually expanded its menu to include a wide range of Indian and international cuisines. Faasos focused on delivering tasty and affordable meals with efficient delivery services.

In addition to operating its own kitchens and delivery fleet, Faasos partnered with local restaurants to offer an even broader selection of dishes. By utilizing technology, they streamlined the ordering process, enabling customers to conveniently place their orders through a user-friendly mobile app or website.

Faasos experienced significant growth and secured funding from various investors, which allowed it to expand its operations across multiple cities in India. To reflect its broader vision of becoming a global cloud kitchen network, the company rebranded itself as Rebel Foods.

Today, Rebel Foods operates several brands, including Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Mandarin Oak, among others. These brands cater to different culinary preferences, offering a diverse range of cuisines and food options to customers. Rebel Foods has revolutionized the food delivery industry in India by leveraging technology, innovation, and a vast network of cloud kitchens, providing a seamless and enjoyable dining experience for its customers.
